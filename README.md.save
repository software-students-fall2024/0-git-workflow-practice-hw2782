[Career Crush: What Is It Like to Be a Software Engineer?](https://hbr.org/2021/07/career-crush-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-software-engineer)

I found this article interesting because it offers a real-life perspective on what it's like to work as a software engineer from someone who has worked at major tech companies like Slack, Lyft, and Stripe. Lindsey Redd's journey from wanting to become a doctor to thriving in software engineering demonstrates how diverse the pathways to this career can be. The article covers various aspects of the job, including coding, collaboration, and problem-solving, which resonate with the complexity of the role.

Another aspect I found fascinating is Lindsey's experience navigating the challenges of being a woman of color in a predominantly white and male-dominated industry. Her determination to overcome imposter syndrome and her emphasis on communication and mentoring within teams highlight the importance of soft skills in the tech industry, beyond just technical abilities.
I found this article about software development trends insightful, 
especially the rise of AI-augmented development. It offers a new 
perspective on how AI is transforming coding processes and developer 
productivity.
